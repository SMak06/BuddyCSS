## Pull requests


**Please ask first** before coding on your own. Even if what you are doing is very cool,
we are maybe working on the same thing or we have already finished but we wait before releasing.


**Do not edit files which are in build folder directly!** Those files are automatically generated.
You should edit the source files in [`/buddycss/src/`](https://github.com/BuddyCSS/BuddyCSS/tree/master/src) instead.
