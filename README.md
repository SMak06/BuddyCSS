## Quick start

- [Download the latest release.](https://buddycss.com/downloads/buddycss-1.0.0-build.zip)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/BuddyCSS/BuddyCSS.git` and install it with `npm install` or `yarn`. Once it is installed, you just have to run `gulp`

BuddyCSS is a **CSS/JS** framework. You can either download the latest release and use the ready-to-use compiled code or clone the repo and get access to Gulp, Sass, Babel, ...



## Browser Support

BuddyCSS is compatible with all modern browers and Internet Explorer 10.



## Vanilla Javascript

To make it easier to implement in others platforms, BuddyCSS has a very light touch of vanilla Javascript (inputs text animation, toggle navigation on mobile, ...)



## Documentation

For now, the documentation is available on [buddyCSS.com](https://buddycss.com/)


## Contact
